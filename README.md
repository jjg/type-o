# Type-O

*"That's not writing, it's typing"*

Type-O is a simple portable writing device consisting of a *nice* keyboard and a 4x40 character LCD screen.  What you type shows-up on the screen and goes into a file.

When you connect Type-O to a computer via USB, it shows-up as a flash drive containing a file that contains your writing.

It can also be used as a nice USB keyboard!

This repository contains source code for Type-O's [firmware](./firmware), [model files](./models) for the printable parts as well as related [documentation](.docs).

Details about the project can be found in the following posts on [jasongullickson.com](https://jasongullickson.com) and under the hashtag #typeo in the fediverse.
